## Support

It would be nice if you leave the credit to me in the footer, unless you make a donation to show support. I can't really police this though, it's MIT licensed anyway so you can do whatever you want with the theme...

If you would like to show your appreciation to me for working on this theme you can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/emhaye">donate with Paypal</a> here.
